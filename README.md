# ABItopic

Get events topic0, function selectors and interact with contracts by the **address** or **ABI**

You only need to copy and paste the contract address or the ABI (in case the code is not validated on http://etherscan.io) to the corresponding input.

Works on Ropsten and Mainnet (default)

Note: This is my first project using react ts so a lot of `any` and bad things was made.
